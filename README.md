# Day 1

- will require sanding down of binding on high side of neck near joint. Binding is fair bit higher than body here


# Day 3

- first batch of order stuff came

- sanded down some of the binding. Much smoother to veneer height but one gauge made in it with my xacto knife. Oh well!

- scale length measurement

# Day 4

- cut headstock 'design' by lopping off an end and sanding it down

- Other order things arrived.

# Day 5

- Taped off the maple veneer and the fretboard completely

- Tested some of the mahogany stain on scrap wood
- sanded 220 grit and applied two coats to the back and neck

**NOTE**: My makeshift gloves for staining just kinda soaked through. Skip em and use a sandwich bag if need be.

- After drying. Went with a ebony grain filler that was slightly diluted with warm water. Dried overnight

# Day 6

- Sanding 220 grit for quite a while. Aimed to get back to close to bare mahogany with filled grain in the dark contrast.

- This took quite a while. The flat back wasn't too bad to get somewhat uniform. However, the sides and curves were not great.

- Added two more coats of mahogany stain

- color darkening up nicely.

# Day 7

- did more sanding on the sides to try and bring down some areas that still had excess ebony filler. This kinda works, but then you quickly go through the previous stain. So this back and forth happens

- Planning some level of light mahogany (brown redish) base application to the maple veneer. I may then try a VERy light sand back given the limited depth of the veneer and then apply my yellow on top. I gotta watch out here as with the yellow and limited sanding options I don't want to go too far on anything.

# Day 7

Time to stain the maple top.

- Removed the tape and retaped the binding edge.
- Lightly sand the veneer with 220 grit then 400grit
- Applied a coat of the mahogany stain to (hopefully) develop a darker brown/red base prior to the yellow
- Exposed glue reside NOT on the center seam, but on the binding edges :(

Will let dry 30min or so

- sanded 400 grit to lightly expose the grain
- applied the yellow on top
